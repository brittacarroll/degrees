# Complete the implementation of the shortest_path function such that it returns the shortest path from the person with id source to the person with the id target.

# Assuming there is a path from the source to the target, 
# your function should return a list, where each list item is 
# the next (movie_id, person_id) pair in the path from the source to the target. 
# Each pair should be a tuple of two strings.
# For example, if the return value of shortest_path were [(1, 2), (3, 4)], 
# that would mean that the source starred in movie 1 with person 2, 
# person 2 starred in movie 3 with person 4, and person 4 is the target.

# If there are multiple paths of minimum length from the source to the target, 
# your function can return any of them.
# If there is no possible path between two actors, 
# your function should return None.
# If the source and target are the same person, 
# then the shortest path is a path of length 0.
# You may call the neighbors_for_person function, w
# hich accepts a personâ€™s id as input, and returns a set of 
# (movie_id, person_id) pairs for all people who starred in a movie with a given person.
# You should not modify 
# anything else in the file other than the shortest_path function, 
# though you may write additional functions and/or import other Python standard library modules. You should not import any third-party 
# Python libraries for this project.
